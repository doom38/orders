# Orders

Orders is very simple web-app written with golang.
The application allows the edition of a list of product, and then an order
list management. All operations are sorted in a json file.

## Build
The simplest method is to use the `Makefile`
```
make compile
``` 
on windows the Makefile must be launched in a git bash console.
